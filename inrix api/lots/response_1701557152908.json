Not fare and not right for the community . I'm only speaking of the place on Leavenworth between Turk and Golden Gate , they are causing great discomfort many many many people and we are just asking with love and respect for community respect for one another ! We all know there are at least 3 different sound levels of the door alarm going off. We ask as a community with love and respect for the lower level sounding alarm only and could they not use the sounding alarm all night long , it's very loud and children and elders can't rest properly , or maybe use no alarm at all.  It seems to me from my observation that it is done on purpose at a very loud level , pretty much all night , just being very mean and evil , this is not right . thank you and GOD Bless , I was trying to get contact with the CEO",

At 11:30 pm, I came back to the passenger rear window totally smashed, and my trunk belongings scattered around. Glass was all over my backseat. Fortunately, I had nothing of significant value in the car and nothing seemed to be stolen. It was a hassle to clean up all the class and drive back with no window in the back. I don't think I will park here again.",

I reported this immediately to an attendant. I later received a letter from Connecticut stating the ding was pre- existing (which is a highly incorrect statement). I asked for evidence to support this claim. The representative from Propark then emailed me a piece of paper from Propark with a car diagram on it with an X on the passenger side door. The representative stated this was the proof that the ding was pre- existing. Unbelievable! This was not a diagram filled out after a joint inspection by the attendant and myself in which I signed in agreement. This was offered after the fact. When I made the initial complaint at Parc 55, the supervisor took a report and did not even mention this \"evidence\". This evidence was created after the report was taken I am sure. Before I leave my car with any valet service, I walk around it in order to check the body. I take very good care of my car. Due to the valet service,\r\nMy family and I will never stay at this location again. Where is the honorable and just business practice? This whole experience was highly unsavory and dishonest.",

The event staff inside the venue were fantastic, however the parking staff in the Masonic parking lot treated us terribly. Upon entry to our event (VIP dashboard confessional and third eye blind event) there was a sign posted saying event parking was $30.  We also received an email from live nation stating the parking was $30. When we paid we were charged $38. The parking attendant called the lot manager, who was EXTREMELY rude to us. He was rude, and talked down to us like a bully and said there was no sign because the event didn't start until 4, when in fact the VIP event started much earlier. He told us too bad, and that he's the manager and no one is going to give us our money back. We asked him if he put up the sign himself and he said no. He said \"well did you take a picture of the sign? Do you have proof?\" He was really mean to us, all over a measly $8. We are more upset over how degrading his speech was than the money itself. We are surely never parking in this parking garage again. He also refused to give our parking ticket back, and when we tried to leave he wouldn't let us out and made us back up and go around just to be rude. We felt like he basically told us to f-off. (Sorry about the language)\r\n",

If they don’t like you for whatever reason they will make it so you can never park in there garage and they will call the garages in the area to make sure you can’t park in the others ones too. They pushed my wife down to the ground because she forgot to leave the keys in her car it took her 5 min before she realized ,she walked home with the keys and she walked back and he pushed her on the ground and spit in her face because she forgot he was so angry he raised his fist at her and was about to hit her and I stopped that bitch beat his ass and called the police citizens arrested his ass. They will hit women and whoever they don’t like  ",

I had no problems all attendants were professionals treated me kindly and were highly informative of monthly rate  how to pay and what was expected. My number was 576 and I truly respect these men who job is customer service with positive attitude and kindness since all they do is park cars and retrieve autos to person daily. I had no problem  all workers from time of open to close were just remarkably respectful professionals with sense of humor. They have rules posted  as you enter the garage. I will always park my car at the state garage whenever I'm in the nob hill neighborhood. ",

When I came back the next day and told him I only needed two days, he quickly told me that two days was $45.00 per day (the same as three).  I asked him to show me where that was posted and he could not.  He became very upset and told me to be quiet and listen to him.

When the manager found out I was simply grabbing something, he lost it on me, started yelling, told me to get out, told me my month contract was cancelled (I was only three days in), and told me to leave.  He tried to reach into my car to grab the monthly parking permit from my rear window, which I obviously need to get a refund.\r\n\r\nA few notes- The garage was very busy and I waited for 15 minutes while they attended to other customers and grabbed my car.  I understand they were really busy, so told them not to worry, that I would park my car on the street and then return later in the evening.  This didn't keep the manager from yelling at me.  He escalated the situation, told me my contract was \"cancelled\".\r\n\r\nI returned to ask for a refund for the days I wont be using.  The manager claimed he can't process the refund, that it needs to come from the management office, and that I would only get 50% back.",

Arrived with plenty of time to get to show, only to find out the garage was full,  no parking!  SpotHero is SpotZero and 6x6 garage continued to let vehicles in when there was Zero parking.  Will not park at 6x6 garage or use SpotHero as they do not manage the parking availability.\r\n\r\nBooked another garage 5 blocks away from the theater.  Due to this inconvenience we were 30 minutes late for my Granddaughter's first broadway show.  We had to walk through homelessness, drug activity to get to the GoldenGate Theater all because of 6x6 garage & SpotHero not managing parking spot availability.  Terribly disappointed!",

Actual sign at entrance says close at 2am on weekends! Guy comes up, immediately starts jabbering away about I have to be back by 11:45 or he locks the gate and it's $30 to get my car in morning. I'm all smiles and laughing and in good spirit despite, say I am going to show will be back, no problem, etc. In the meantime he's asking me why I don't park in the street, says there's parking there, etc etc. I'm like, I'm in a rush already and feel safer leaving my car in garage. He takes my $20, continues blabbering, saying I could park in the street. I'm just laughing nicely still, again point out I'm in a rush would prefer to park and go. Ask about the hours posted. He's like, 11:45 is when YOU must be here, midnight is when I GO HOME. I'm just like okay, no problem, maybe should change the signs to reflect actual business hours, all very nicely. At that point he tells me to leave, to go park on the street. Rudely and curtly. I'm like, still super friendly, but I ask him, what? Are you serious? You don't want my money? You don't want my business? Really? He responds no, continues being a jerk, hands me my $20 back and watched as I had to back up down the long narrow entrance and leave. I couldn't find street parking, ended up at an",

I paid in case at the machine in the lobby of the building and was charged the exorbitant sum of $27.  That's bad enough.  I paid with two $20 bills.  After I'd inserted the first $20, the machine prompted me to insert more money.  After inserting the second $20, I was informed that the machine owed me $13.  It returned only $8.  While I was reacting to that, the robovoice inside the thieving device asked if I wanted a receipt.  Before I could press the button, the machine cut off access to it and returned to its resting state, leaving me without either the $5 it had stolen from me or the receipt.  I want my $5 back and I should like to know that someone is investigating this machine to determine what is wrong with its settings.  It may well be doing this to a large number of people every day, exacting its own robo-tolls.  I know it's only $5, but I am not willing to let this go and will press Ace Parking to correct this situation.",

Today there are 3 car street parking spots directly in front of there front entrance with broken car window glass on the sidewalk.  That's 3 separate car parking spaces meaning 3 separate cars have been broken into directly in front of their business at 711 Van Ness Ave.  Both the trash bins and the broken window glass have been an issue for 711 Van Ness Ave before.  I don't trust them to safely keep my car in their garage and I don't trust them to maintain a safe clean setting outside their business as well.  I have never used their garage and I tell others to avoid the business as well.",

The guys working refused to show us all the times they moved the car, would only show us 3 out of 4 moves. Then they claimed because the cameras were too low resolution we couldn’t prove it was their fault. We have multiple company cars parked here and will be switching all of them. This is the last and worst of a long line of incidents with this garage. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!",

When I got to the parking lot, I was told it as completely full and that they could not get me a parking space. They said that even if there was a spot available that they would not honor the parking pass because the parking for that day was not $15 dollars that I paid, but $40 dollars and I would have to pay the difference. I told them that I would pay the difference and the lot attendant said no, that there was no parking spaces, I clearly saw one in front. I got there around 7:45 pm, the event started at 8 pm. I assumed that by booking a space using the ParkWhiz app I was guaranteed a parking space. No where in the posting did I see that they would make me pay the difference either. I asked for a refund and they said that I would have to get it through ParkWhiz. The whole situation was handled unprofessionally by the park attendant. The park attendant was the owner because the other employee there told me he was. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT. They do not honor your parking space and they will make you pay the difference if they decide the parking is more money than is posted on this app. They tried to convince me that it was the parking app ParkWhiz's fault as apparently, \"they do not have control of what price it is posted on the website.\" I call this bullshit because there are other parking lot posts that show a different price. Also, they decided to advertise i",

At 2:30am, when I went to retrieve my vehicle in order to return it to the airport and catch a flight, the garage was closed with no staff around. The multiple contact numbers online did not work and ACE parking claimed it should've been open. I spoke to the neighbouring hotel and they claimed the garage had been operating 24hrs since at least march. This resulted in me missing my flight and having to pay a fee to change to a later flight. This is a cowboy operation, do not park at this location. ",

I was in at 9:57 am (their time stamp) and out before 3pm.  The machine wanted $35.  I canceled the transaction and spoke to the guy in the office.  He said they do not have an early bird special.\r\n2) The fee for 12 hours is not $32 as mentioned on this website.  For less than 5 hours I had to pay $35.\r\nGood points are that the structure is quite easy to get into and leave, and there was space for me to park.",

They relied on the garage to take care of the vehicle and when we got was nothing but negligence. One of the attendants ran the car into the wall of the elevator and did not report what they did causing nearly a $1000 in damage to the car. Luckily we had a dash cam and found where they ran into the wall and presented the information to the manager Tovik. youtu.be/i7Dkj-myY5E . Tovik was kind enough and provided contact information regarding the lot owner, but the owner refused to acknowledge repeated calls and emails over 2 weeks even though we have evidence that they caused the damage. Now I need to sue the idiot and he gets to pay legal fees on top of the damages. DO NOT TRUST YOUR VEHICLE TO THIS NEGLIGENT OWNER!",

I was verbally harassed and pestered by a \"street person\" who follwed me into the waiting area as I presented my blue claim check. I ignored and made zero eye contact with this Caucasian 40-year-old who persisted on having a conversation with me. The 490 Post Street Garage valet proceeded quickly to retrieve my car and help me to the safety of my locked car. The \"street person commented, \"What a nice ride.\" By this time approximately 5 minutes, the street person exited, and the valet ran out of the driveway to usher me out to safety. I am so sad about the state of affairs in our downtown area of San Francisco. I am a 5th generation native and thank you for helping me last night.",
